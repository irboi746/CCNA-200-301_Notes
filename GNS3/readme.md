# GNS3
## Introduction
* GNS3 stands for Graphical Network Simulator
* GNS is an emulator as it is running an **actual OS image** whereas a simluator is a program built from scratch to simulate the actual software.
* GNS is named a simulator as it simulates the network, but it emulates a cisco machine, therefore Cisco iOS images is needed.
* Therefore to create a CCNA lab with GNS, we would need to consider the iOS image used.
* GNS3 has documentations on supported Cisco IOS images and installation guides.
* **c3725** and **c3745** IOS images are recommended as it comes with switching and routing module.
